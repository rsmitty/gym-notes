## Ingredients

- 6 Eggs
- 1 lb Lean Ground Beef (I used 7%)
- 6 slices Cheese (I used Colby Jack from Aldi)
- 6 English Muffins
- Spray Oil

## Directions

- Scramble up the eggs. Put in a sprayed glass dish (I have a 9x9 for this) and bake at 420 for 10m or until done. Note you can also just scramble up the eggs if you want, but they're hard to keep on the muffin.
- Once eggs are done, cut into six pieces.
- Divide the ground beef into 6 patties and cook on a skillet for 2-3 mins per side or until done.
- Cut the english muffins in half.
- Add beef patty, egg, and cheese. Wrap with aluminum foil.
- Heat for 1.5 mins in the microwave when ready to eat.
