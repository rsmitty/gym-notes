# Instant Pot Pulled Chicken

This is a super easy way to cook a bunch of chicken.
It's also versatile, as you can switch up the seasonings for stuff like chicken tacos.
Simply add some taco seasoning and salt/pepper instead of the other stuff.

Note: The only thing actually tracked here is the chicken.
The broth isn't used after cooking and I think the amount of extra calories from it would be negligible.

Note: You can also reuse the broth in the sauce in meal prep recipes like [Philly Cheese Steak Pasta](./philly-cheese-steak-pasta.md) if you want to make it with chicken instead of beef.

## Ingredients

- ~2.5-3 lbs Chicken Breasts
- 2.5 cups Chicken Bone Broth (or regular broth)
- Seasonings: Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder

## Directions

- Trim chicken and add to bottom of instant pot.
- Add broth to pot, adding more if chicken isn't fully covered.
- Hit the whole thing with seasonings.
You will want to use quite a lot of salt if the broth isn't already salted.
- Pressure cook for 10 mins.
- Let naturally vent for an additional 5 mins.
- Release the pressure.
- Remove and shred up the chicken.
