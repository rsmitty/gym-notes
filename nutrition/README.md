# Nutrition

This directory holds recipes that I've either come up with or copied from someone else.
Even the copies almost always have some modifications of my own.

Generally, because I mostly train like a powerlifter, my goals are to get a bodyweight's worth of protein in grams every day.
I rarely get quite that high, but ~200g is pretty readily hit for me.
As such, you'll mostly find that all recipes I make have a pretty high protein component.

You'll also find that I'm "hand wavey" in recipes (like "use 2-ish pound of chicken" or something similar).
I tend to just update the amount in my tracking app to reflect whatever quantity I actually used, as it's impossible to get the same weight week in and out.
Similarly, a tablespoon of something is generally something I eyeball in a recipe unless it's something more caloric like an oil.

In regards to said "tracking app", I use MacroFactor.
It's a paid app and fairly expensive, as you have to do a yearly license.
That said, it's very powerful and makes tracking macros much less frictionless once you get the hang of it.

## Must Haves

Some things that I think are super useful for the kitchen in general and that I assume in these recipes:

- Food Scale
- Measuring Cups + Spoons
- Strainer
- Storage Containers (I use https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GHB9IU. Glass is nice b/c they don't get funky over time.)
- Big Pot/Bowl for Mixing (I've got a big stockpot from a restaurant supply store)

**Note:** Generally speaking, it's super useful to hit up a restaurant supply store for kitchen stuff.
Think cutting boards, stock pots, mixing bowls, etc.
Their prices are usually great and you can get the same stuff someone would use in a restaurant.
