# Dill Chicken Salad

We make this recipe a lot and use it to make chicken salad wraps as an easy dinner.
Protein wraps and mixed greens from Aldi work well for this.

Note: I use the [Instant Pot Pulled Chicken](../meal-prep/instant-pot-pulled-chicken.md) as the base for the chicken on this.
A rotisserie chicken also works well if you want something pre-cooked.
